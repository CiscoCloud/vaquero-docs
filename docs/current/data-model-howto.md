## Data Model Diagram to show relationships
Each site contains an `environment file` and an `inventory file` that lists all related hosts. Hosts are members of a single `host group`. `Host groups` reference `os` and `assets`. Note re-use of `host groups`, `os` and `assets`.

### Introduction

The Vaquero data model is meant to be a declarative representation of the state of your data center. You specify the state you want your baremetal to be in, and Vaquero takes the steps to get there.

We treat this data model as a "single source of truth" (SoT) that describes the operating state of your data center. The data model is [parsed and verified](https://ciscocloud.github.io/vaquero-docs/docs/current/validator.html), then deployed to an on-site Vaquero Agent for execution.

## <a name="key-concepts">Key Concepts</a>

Your data center is expressed as an inventory of _hosts_. Each host belongs to a _host group_. Each host group uses a combination of _unattended assets_ and _operating system_ definitions to define a target configured state for a host.

## <a name="vocabulary">Vocabulary</a>

*Site*: A managed data center, or group of machines managed by a single Vaquero Agent.

*Host*: A single managed machine. Definition includes identifying attributes (selectors), host-specific metadata, information for LOM (IPMI), and an association to a single host group.

*Operating System*: An "installation" template containing the details to perform a network boot into a particular OS, specifying kernel, initrd, boot command-line parameters, unattended config, etc.

*Unattended Assets*: An optionally templated unattended config/script (i.e. cloud-init, ignition, kickstart, etc) used for unattended boot and installation operations.

*Host Group*: A collection that ties together operating systems and unattended assets. Describes a target state for hosts to reach.

## <a name="where-things-go">Where Things Go</a>

Configuration files are placed in a directory hierarchy. Vaquero parses site configurations by reading files placed in specially named subdirectories. The root of your configuration path has four directories:

1. **assets**: grouped by type. These are generally unattended configs or scripts that have been templated to include environment-specific information. Contains named subdirectories (more on that later).
2. **os**: Individual documents describing family, version, kernel/image location, and boot/installation options for any operating systems used by host groups.
3. **boot**: Individual documents combining operating system and unattended asset information to describe a target host state.
4. **sites**: One or more sites (each in it's own subdirectory) that share the same boot, os, and asset definitions. Each site includes environment-specific information (Vaquero Agent URLs/certs, subnets, other metadata), and an inventory of hosts that apply boot definitions to machines.

```
.
├── assets
├── os
├── boot
└── sites
```

### Assets

Assets are grouped into named subdirectories based on type. There are currently four types:

1. Cloud-Config: [CoreOS Cloudinit System](https://coreos.com/os/docs/latest/cloud-config.html)
2. Ignition: [CoreOS Ignition](https://coreos.com/ignition/docs/latest/)
3. Kickstart: [Fedora Project Kickstart](http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda/Kickstart)
4. Untyped: Miscellaneous files. Can be used for "unsupported" configuration types.

Each asset is placed under a subdirectory according to it's type. Assets are referenced by file name from host groups:

```
.
└── assets
    ├── cloud-config
    │   └── base.yml
    ├── ignition
    │   ├── etcd.yml
    │   └── raid-fmt.yml
    ├── kickstart
    │   └── clevos.yml
    └── untyped
        ├── autoyast.xml
        └── preseed.cfg
```


Validation is performed on typed assets to verify that rendered templates produce valid configurations.

Assets are retrieved dynamically from the Vaquero Agent through typed endpoints. Query parameters are included in the request to render the asset for a particular host:

- `/cloud-config` -- Cloud-config assets
- `/ignition` -- Ignition assets
- `/kickstart` -- Kickstart assets
- `/untyped` -- Untyped assets

For instance, a host with mac address `00:00:00:00:00:01` could retrieve it's rendered ignition configuration by requesting

```
{{.agent.url}}/ignition?mac=00:00:00:00:00:01
```

### Operating Systems

Operating systems exist as individual documents under the `os` subdirectory. They are referenced by a self-assigned ID described in the document:

```
.
└── os
    ├── centos-7.yml
    ├── clevos-3.yml
    └── coreos-1053.12.0.yml
```

### Host Groups

Host groups exist as individual documents under the `boot` subdirectory. They are referenced by a self-assigned ID described in the document:

```
.
└── boot
    ├── etcd-cluster.yml
    └── etcd-proxy.yml
```

### Sites

Sites are represented by individual subdirectories. One directory == one site == one managed group of machines. Each SoT can contain multiple sites. Each of these sites shares the same assets/boot/os configuration files.

Each site has _at least_ two documents, the specially named `env.yml` and at least one document describing an inventory of hosts. You may use YAML's triple-dash `---` separator to combine multiple inventory documents into one file.

```
.
└── sites
    ├── site-a
    │   ├── env.yml
    │   └── inventory.yml
    └── site-a
        ├── env.yml
        ├── inventory.yml
        └── another-inv.yml
```

## <a name="rough-workflow">Rough Workflow</a>

Configurations are roughly executed in the following order:

1. Host makes DHCP request.
2. DHCP causes host to chainload iPXE (`undionly.kpxe`) and indicates Vaquero Agent as next-server
3. Vaquero Agent provides a default iPXE script to discover basic host information (mac, uuid, domain, hostname)
4. Host requests dynamic iPXE script based on basic information
5. Vaquero Agent renders iPXE script using os, boot, and host information
6. Host executes iPXE script, requesting resources (kernel, intitrd, unattended configs/scripts) as required

The default ipxe script chains back to Vaquero Agent, injecting basic information:

```
#!ipxe
chain ipxe?uuid=${uuid}&mac=${net0/mac:hexhyp}&domain=${domain}&hostname=${hostname}&domain=${domain}
```


## <a name="serving-files">Serving Files</a>

Vaquero Agent will expose an endpoint `/files` for hosting static content. This endpoint acts transparently as a file server, or a reverse proxy, according to the configuration file.

## Identifying a Host

A booting machine is identified as a particular host based on the selecting information used. Currently, a host will be identified by `mac` and `uuid`, as reported by iPXE.

Additionally, a specific callback may be made to Vaquero Agent that includes a custom selection parameter

```
curl "{{.agent.url}}/ignition?mac={{.host.mac}}&os=installed" -o ignition.json
```


When identifying a host, Vaquero Agent will:

1. Only select a host where all the selectors apply
2. Select the host where the most selectors apply

For example, given these two hosts:

```
---
boot: group_one
hosts:
- name: host1
  selectors:
    mac: 00:00:00:00:00:01
---
boot: group_two
hosts:
- name: host1_plus_some
  selectors:
    mac: 00:00:00:00:00:01
    os: installed
```


For a host requesting `/ignition?mac=00:00:00:00:00:01`, group_one will be matched (rule #1).
For a host requesting `/ignition?mac=00:00:00:00:00:01&os=installed`, group_two will be matched (rule #2).


## <a name="metadata-and-templating">Metadata and Templating</a>

Templates are written using [Go's standard templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/). Templated information occurs in the following areas:

1. In any files under `assets`
2. In os objects in `boot.kernel`, `boot.initrd`, and values in `cmdline`

Metadata is used primarily to render templated information. It is "unstructured" data, consisting of nested key-value maps, and lists. Metadata is included in three separate places in your configuration:

1. In the environment `env.yml` file
2. In a boot file
3. In an inventory document, under each host

Metadata is made available during template execution as separate fields under the template's "dot". With a few exceptions, each entry directly relates to the scheme. The cases where proxies or other values are included are noted:

1. `.env`: the site's Environment information.
  - `.env.agentURL`: The scheme://host:port that the host can use to reach Vaquero Agent.
2. `.boot`: the current Boot
  - `.boot.configURL`: The scheme://host:port/path?query needed to retrieve the unattended configuration information for the boot. Used for manually inserting config retrieval, i.e. ClevOS answers.
  - `.boot.{operating_system,os}`: the OS ID is replaced with the Operating System object that it refers to
3. `.host`: the current Host
  - `.host.interfaces.subnet`: subnet ID is replaced with Subnet object that it refers to
4. `.interface`: the Interface that the Host is using to connect with Vaquero Agent
  - `.interface.subnet`: subnet ID is replaced with Subnet object that it refers to

* Any object/scheme that includes `metadata` proxies the same information under `md`
* ex: `env.metadata.initial_etcd_cluster` == `env.md.initial_etcd_cluster`

By way of example, this template snippet defines a networkd configuration:

```
networkd:
  units:
    - name: 10-static.network
      contents: |
        [Match]
        MACAddress={{.interface.mac}}
        [Network]
        Gateway={{.interface.subnet.gateway}}
        DNS={{index .interface.subnet.dns 0}}
        Address={{.interface.ipv4}}
```

## <a name="translation-to-ipxe">Translation to iPXE</a>

Currently, all network boots and installations are performed using iPXE scripts. Operating system boot parameters and command line options are translated into iPXE scripts to perform boot/installation tasks.

Any unattended configs or scripts included in a boot are inserted during this process. Inconsistencies (i.e. using ignition for a CentOS operating system) should be detected during validation.

### Command Line Parameters

Rules for translating command line parameters:

1. Keys with empty values (i.e. "" or '') are formatted as `key` in the boot options
2. Keys with non-empty values are formatted as `key=value` in the boot options
3. Keys that contain a list will be included once each time for every list element. If a list element cannot be parsed not a string (i.e. is a map, list, etc), it is ignored.

For example, given this OS:

```
---
id: centos-example
major_version: '7'
minor_version: '2'
os_family: CentOS
release_name: stable
boot:
  kernel: centos_kernel
  initrd:
  - centos_initrd
cmdline:
  console:
    - ttyS0,115200
    - ttyS1
    - nested_map: is
      ignored: true
    - same:
      - with
      - nested
      - lists
  lang: ' '
  debug: ''
  enforcing: ''
```


The iPXE script will be roughly generated as (not taking unattended info from boot):

```
    #!ipxe
    kernel centos_kernel console=ttyS0,115200 console=ttyS1 lang=  debug enforcing
    initrd centos_initrd
    boot
```


Note how `lang` appears with a trailing `=`, because it's value was non-empty `' '`
